### Server Token
A server token can be used to access data that does not require a Foodetective user context. It can be generated using the OAuth 2.0 client_credentials flow. Please note that your server token is considered sensitive and it is your responsibility to protect it.

### User Access Token
A user access token is required when a Foodetective user context is necessary. The Foodetective API uses OAuth 2.0 to allow developers to get a user access token to access a single userâ€™s data or do actions on their behalf. OAuth 2.0 is a specification outlined in RFC 6749 that allows third-party services to make requests on behalf of a user without accessing passwords and other sensitive information.

You can find informations on how to obtain each token in the API documentaion.
