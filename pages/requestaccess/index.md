### Contact

{% callout %}
Contact the Foodetective team and share the client_id for your application to request access to the trusted, public and refresh_token scopes. Once your application is whitelisted you will be able to make request to the API.
{% /callout %}

### Identifying your application

{% callout %}
The client_id identifies your application. Treat it like a username. The client_secret is your applicationâ€™s password. Protect it like a password and contact the Foodetective team should you ever suspect it has been leaked.
