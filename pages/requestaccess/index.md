### Contact
Contact the Foodetective team and share the `client_id` for your application to request access to the trusted, public and `refresh_token` scopes. Once your application is whitelisted you will be able to make request to the API.

### Identifying your application
The `client_id` identifies your application. Treat it like a username. The `client_secret` is your applicationâ€™s password. Protect it like a password and contact the Foodetective team should you ever suspect it has been leaked.
